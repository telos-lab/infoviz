Also it seemed that the professors did not either understand their own questions or answers they were often left puzzled bu the others answer sheets and this took a considerable amount of time which was very unnecessary. Also the assignments were not fully thought through in my opinion. When working on the assignments i was often left struggling with importing libraries or stuck searching for datasets for hours with no real help available. The only link that was provided for us for help with searching for datasets was not very helpful at all a was embedded in the footnotes of the first assignment pdf with a font of about 5. This needs to be improved. The course material discussed how we need to visualize the data that we are trying to show and what techniques we can use to show even complex data but the assignments felt like they were apart of an entirely different course, information searching. I know it is an important part of information visualization also but this ballooned the workload too much. I think this needs to be improved drastically. The assignments were asking for too much and they missed the course topic entirely. They were not very enjoyable and with other courses also going on they did not do anything but raise my stress. Also the Thursday deadline was weird, it felt like there was only Monday to Thursday to work on the assignment since we had the lecture on Monday and there was often more very necessary info about the assignment instrucitons there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's hard to say anything about the exam, as it has not occurred yet, but this feedback form closes on the same day and I have another exam then too, so I won't have time to fill this then.

Furthermore, I really found it unmotivating to hear justifications for correct answers that are aching to ""the answers are the way they are because the lecturer intended the question to be interpreted in this particular way"", when, in fact, there was no clear reason to interpret the question in the sought-after way!
To this end, I completely gave up on trying to learn anything from the quizes.


Some of the home assignment descriptions were very unclear and/or vague.

Also, when it came to finding _available_ datasets relating to the UN SDGs, I want to say that, at least w.r.t. the 6th SDG there was very little open data available. The majority  of the data I came across was 'open' in the sense that they'd hand it over once I requested the data -- this is of course unacceptable since I can't wait for who knows how long to get the data, the quality and formatting of which I can only assess when I've gotten it.

It can help increasing students engagement into the course. Contact exercise sessions would also be much appreciated. I think the course should guide students, and guidance means setting some restrictions. You should, for instance, accept Python implementation of the exercises as the one and only. Then you should do a proper introductory round into Python's basics in terms of data visualizing. I also think you should restrict the choice for datasets for completing exercises. Ideally, the course staff should provide all necessary data. After all, the idea of the course is in practicing data visualization and not data search. In the future, you could provide let's say four data sets for each assignment, giving a student an opportunity to choose one of them for completion. And then when those restrictions are set, you could finally organize contact exercise sessions. In this case, TAs would know the expected outcome of each exercise, and thus could help and guide students effectively. Now the whole course just feels like do-it-yourself course.

Also, they didn't show much enthusiasm about the topic.

The lecture slides were outdated, as pointed out by the professor. However, it was good that during these courses the slides were updated in some parts.

The right answers to the quizes were impossible to get right as they measured more about opinions and perception than facts.

Most of my time went into finding and editing datasets. It could have boosted my learning a lot, if the course staff had picked suitable data sets to the assignments. I see the value in having to find the datasets. Still, I think it would have been better if most of the datasets would have been ready and there had been just couple of tasks, were I would had to find my own data set.

The TA's gave the same feedback to every task in every assignment. I understand that sometimes giving feedback can be hard. However, this seems odd and didn't support much my learning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By that I mean the order of the slides. Because I'm taking note, sometimes it's unclear which section we are at (because some slides are ""intro"" slides to each section ). To improve this, you should have the number of the section on each slide.  For example, if we are talking about data-ink ratio, every slide related to that section should have ""1.1.

Tämä korostui esimerkiksi tehtävien arvioinnin epäjohdonmukaisuuksina sekä siinä, että Quiz tarkistus luennoilla kurssihenkilökohta ei edes itse osannut tulkita kysymyksiä oikein eivätkä osanneet perustella oikeita vastauksia. Miten oppilaiden tulisi oppia, kun edes kurssin pitäjät eivät ole suunnitelleet kurssin sisältöä huolella? 

Myöskin viikottaisten assignmenttien arviointi oli ainakin ensimmäisillä viikoilla älyttömän tiukkaa. Yksi kaverini menetti yhtä paljon pisteitä siitä, että vastaus ei ollut tapreeksi persoonallinen kuin toinen joka oli jättänyt vastaamatta kokonaiseen osatehtävään. Tämä on todella epämotivoivaa sille, joka on kuitenkin tehnyt tehtävän. Kannustaisin siis suhteuttamaan sankioita niin, ettei kaikkia pisteitä menetä tehtävistä, joitka on tehnyt, vain pienien virheiden takia.

Kysymysten asettelu ja tehtävien ohjeet olivat koko kurssin aikana hämmentäviä ja epäselviä. Varsinki Quiz:ien kysymykset olivat liian vaikeita ja monimutkaisia. Oman käsitykseni mukaan, kaikki opiskelukaverini kokivat isoja haasteita niiden ymmärtämisessä. Tehtävien ohjeissa taas olisi todella hyvä kertoa tarkalleen mitä vaaditaan ja mistä pisteet tulevat. Itse tein älyttömän pitkiä vastauksia sen pelossa, että en vain satu mainitsemaan jotain asiaa, josta sitten lähtee suhteettoman paljon pisteitä. Eli selkeät arviointikriteerit olisivat hyvin tärkeät, näin säästettäisiin assistenttien ja opiskelijoiden aikaa. 

Lisäksi kurssin esitietovaatimuksissa ei painoteta tarpeeksi jos ollenkaan, että kurssi toteutetaan koodaamalla. Se kannattaa mainita, sillä koodaamiseen tai koodaustyökaluihin ei anneta ollenkaan neuvoja kurssin aikana ensimäisen luennon jälkeen. Tämä ensimmäisella luennolla tapahtunut ohjeistus oli myös niin korkealentoista, että oppilas, joka ei ole ennen koodannut, ei pysty mitenkään saamaan siitä mitään irti. 

Lopuksi, minua vaivasti paljon se, ettei kurssihenkilökuntaan voinut ottaa yhteyttä kurssin aikana, sillä henkilökunnan mukaan kaikki kurssiin liityen lähetetyt sähköpostit luetaan vasta kurssin jälkeen. Tämä tuntui hyvin ikävältä. Olisin toivonut, että oppilaat olisi kohdattu kurssin aikana niin, että omiin huoliin olisi vastattu. Ei ongelmat enää kurssin jälkeen paina mieltä, kun se on jo suoritettu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
